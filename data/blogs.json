    "content": "I love the ocean. I always have.\n\nBut sometimes I wonder… do I have to drown to prove it?\nI don’t want to disappear in what I love. I just want to feel it, let it move me, let it stay a part of me without taking me apart.\n\nSome love asks too much. True love? True love lets you breathe."
